    The sea is one of the most beautiful blessings for man,
    <b>which shows the greatness of the Creator.</b> Words canâ€™t describe the sea beauty and charm, which is an inspiration to many poets and writers. Poems and thoughts that talked about sea are uncountable.
    The beach is my favorite place. <b>Sit down to relax and think.</b> I also go to it to practice many activities and games.
    I join my friends in playing treasure hunt in the sand, which is based on hiding various objects down the sand and writing instructions on paper cards to help others reach them.
